 # Skin Cancer Detection Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for skin cancer detection using images of skin lesions. The model utilizes deep
learning techniques and neural networks to classify skin lesions as malignant or benign.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prajeethpoojary/Skin-CancerDetection.git
   cd Skin-CancerDetection

[Live Site](https://skin-cancer-check.streamlit.app/)

## Running

1. Create a virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment

    for Linux and Mac:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    for Windows:

    ```bash
   cd venv\Scripts   , activate.bat
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```
4. Change the path of the model in Skin-Cancer-Detection-master\About.py
                                OR
   place the project in  "D:\final project\project"  example
     D:\final project\project\EfficientNetB5
     D:\final project\project\prediction
     D:\final project\project\Skin-Cancer-Detection-master
     D:\final project\project\ResNet50

1. Run the app

    ```bash
    streamlit run ./About.py
    ```
